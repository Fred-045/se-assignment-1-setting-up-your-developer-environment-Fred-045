Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:


1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11


   When selecting an operating system for your development environment, especially for web applications, it's important to consider personal preferences, project requirements, and tool compatibility. Choosing Windows offers several advantages: compatibility with a wide range of software and development tools, a user-friendly interface, and seamless integration with Microsoft technologies like .NET, Azure, and SQL Server. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows running Linux distributions alongside Windows, and it supports various development environments. To set up your development environment on Windows, install essential software such as a web browser, Visual Studio Code, and Git, enable and install WSL, set up development tools and a database, and configure your IDE and version control system.







2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download



   TO install a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) suitable for your programming languages and workflow, follow these steps:

Choosing an IDE or Text Editor
Popular Options:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Suitable for JavaScript, Python, PHP, Java, and more. Features include extensions, debugging, an integrated terminal, and Git integration.
extens

Installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Download VS Code:

Visit the Visual Studio Code website and click the Download button for Windows.
Install VS Code:

Open the downloaded installer and follow the prompts: accept the license agreement, choose the installation location, select additional tasks, and click Install.
Launch VS Code:

Once installed, launch VS Code and optionally set it as your default text editor.
Configuring Visual Studio Code


Install Extensions:
Open the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
Search for and install extensions like Python (Microsoft’s Python extension), JavaScript/TypeScript (ESLint, Prettier), and Git Integration (GitLens).


Customize Settings:
Open the Settings view by clicking the gear icon in the lower-left corner and selecting Settings, or by pressing Ctrl+,.
Adjust settings such as theme (e.g., Dark+, Light+), font size, and editor configurations (e.g., tab size, auto-save).


Set Up Integrated Terminal:
Open the integrated terminal by pressing Ctrl+` and use it to run command-line tools, manage version control with Git, and execute scripts.This setup ensures you have a product



3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

   f you want to enhance your chosen text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with extensions, plugins, and add-ons, here are the steps you can follow:

Unfold Extensions/Plugins Marketplace:

Start up your text editor or IDE such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA or Sublime Text.

Look for a section called “Extensions”, ”Plugins” or ”Marketplace” that is usually located in the side bar or reachable from the menu.

Explore Categories:

Look through categories like “Most Popular”, “Recommended” or specific categories such as “Programming Languages” or “Productivity Tools”.

Search for Specific Extensions:

In the search bar find extensions according to what you need. E.g.,

Syntax Highlighting: This makes it simpler to read code by using color to differentiate between different parts of your program code.

Linting: This involves checking your codes for errors or style issues (for example ESLint for JavaScript).

Code Formatting: When coding according to certain rules this automatically formats your script (e.g. Prettier).

Version Control Integration: This improves functionality of Git (such as GitLens for Visual Studio Code).

Install Extensions:

To read more about an extension click on it.

Click install/download button so that you can have it in your editor.

Follow additional prompts if any appear.

Configure Extensions:

According to how you want them configured, change the settings of the installed extension after installation has been done.

Typically access settings by way of it



9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

    How to Set Up Your Developer Environment: A Comprehensive Guide

It is essential to set up a developer’s environment for efficient coding and project management. This document aims at providing an outline on how to create a strong development environment, including configurations, customs and troubleshooting procedures.

Picking an Operating System
Choose an operating system (for example Windows, macOS, Linux) depending on the compatibility with your development tools and personal preference.

Installing Essential Software
2.1 The Text Editor or IDE

Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

Download VS Code from Visual Studio Code website.

Install using the downloaded installer and follow the prompts.

To make it the default text editor choose Preferences -> File Associated -> Markdown -> Change All.

2.2 Version Control System

Git:

Download Git from official Git website.

Go ahead and Run the Installer if you want the default settings.

Configure Git:

sh

Copy code

git config --global user.name “Your Name”

git config --global user.email “your.email@example.com”

2.3 Web Browser

Install any modern web browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox for testing web applications.
